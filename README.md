Little project on Python and PyGame

1) If you need to start programm use Python 
windows: python main.py
linux/mac: python3 main.py

2) If you have error when it start and console sey's "No module named 'pygame'"
You need to use next command: 'pip install pygame'

3) At now it's all. In the future i'll make exe file for Windows, and run file for Mac/Linux
